## Plans
I want to create all of the tools that I use the most in my workflow, which are:
- **Whiteboard** - inspired by [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
- **Note taking app** - absolutely in love with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- **Quick IDE** - for a time when I want to quickly check some code (something like [leetcode playground](https://leetcode.com/playground/))
